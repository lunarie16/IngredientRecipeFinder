# IngridientRecipeFinder
This is a project for "Advanced Softwaretechnique" where a fixed website with vegan recipes is scraped and depending ingredients are extract. You can search by a (list of) ingredient(s) to find matching recipes. Let's reduce some food waste!
It is using the recipes from Bianca Zapatka, whom provides really good, easy and vegan recipes on her website/blog.

installing dependencies: 
pip install -r requirements.txt


crawl data:
sh start.sh 

(even if data is already crawled, you can start the program like that. if you want to start it with python (and have the data crawled) type: python main.py)
